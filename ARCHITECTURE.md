# Agent Architecture Documentation

## Overview

SeekleAI's lead generation system is powered by intelligent agents that continuously scan and analyze data from multiple sources to identify and qualify potential leads.

## Agent System Architecture

### 1. Data Collection Agents

#### Source-Specific Agents
- **LinkedIn Agent**: Monitors company pages, employee profiles, and business updates
- **Reddit Agent**: Analyzes community discussions for market sentiment and pain points
- **Naukri Agent**: Tracks job postings and hiring patterns for growth signals
- **MCA21 Agent**: Monitors company registrations and compliance data
- **News Agent**: Scans industry publications for funding, expansion, and market news
- **Forum Agent**: Monitors industry-specific forums for technical discussions

#### Agent Capabilities
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous scanning with configurable intervals
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful data collection within platform guidelines
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and failover strategies
- **Data Validation**: Real-time quality checks during collection

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Data Ingestion
```
Raw Data → Normalization → Validation → Storage
```

#### Stage 2: Signal Detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: AI models identify relevant business signals
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Natural language processing for market sentiment
- **Trend Detection**: Time-series analysis for growth patterns
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual activity or opportunities

#### Stage 3: Data Fusion
- **Entity Resolution**: Matching companies across different sources
- **Data Enrichment**: Combining information for comprehensive profiles
- **Duplicate Removal**: Intelligent deduplication algorithms
- **Quality Scoring**: Confidence metrics for each data point

### 3. ICP Matching Engine

#### Machine Learning Models
- **Classification Models**: Binary classification for ICP fit
- **Scoring Models**: Numerical ranking for lead prioritization
- **Clustering Models**: Grouping similar companies for pattern analysis
- **Recommendation Models**: Suggesting optimal engagement strategies

#### Matching Criteria
- **Firmographic Data**: Company size, industry, location, revenue
- **Technographic Data**: Technology stack and digital presence
- **Behavioral Signals**: Online activity and engagement patterns
- **Intent Signals**: Purchase intent and research behavior

### 4. Lead Qualification Process

#### Scoring Dimensions
1. **Fit Score** (0-100): How well the company matches your ICP
2. **Intent Score** (0-100): Likelihood of being in-market
3. **Timing Score** (0-100): Optimal engagement timing
4. **Contact Score** (0-100): Availability of quality contact information

#### Output Format
```json
